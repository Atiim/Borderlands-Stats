Introduction

The general rule for variable abbreviations goes as follows:
	
	1. First letter(s) of each stat is abbreviated
	2. First letter(s) of each effect is abbreviated
 
So a skill such as :

	Willing
	+15% Shield Recharge Rate per Level
	-12%  Shield Recharge Delay per Level

Would be abbreviated to:

	WillingSRR;
	WillingSRD;
